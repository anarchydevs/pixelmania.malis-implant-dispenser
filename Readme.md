To be used with AOSharp Clientless. This bot was made to fully automate implant making and buying. The bot has to be placed inside an implant shop (like Borealis layout one) close to the 'Advanced Shiny Cluster' shop. It features:

- AOsetup links for full autonomous buying / tradeskilling
- Alternatively use the designer command
- Quickly make implants with one liner commands (example: create 159 head cl perception dimach)
- Laddering command to automatically make stamina / agility / treatment implants
- Place an order from anywhere, just make sure to claim it before the timer expires
- Bot automatically blacklists people whose orders have expired (you can pay the bot back the debt to get removed from the blacklist)

Quick first time setup guide:
- Put a implant dispenser inside your first inventory slot, then backpacks afterwards (leave at least 12 empty slots)
- Give your bot a bunch of credits (don't give it exactly 1bil, something like 950m is fine)
- Position your bot inside a implant shop close to 'Advanced Shiny Cluster' terminal.
- Launch the plugin once so it creates a Settings.json file inside the plugin .dll folder then close the console
- Match all the trade skills inside the settings file with your bots trade skills (Don't buff your bot with trade skill buffs) and save changes to the settings file
- Relaunch the plugin
- Enjoy
