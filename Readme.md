To be used with AOSharp Clientless. This bot was made to fully automate implant making and buying. The bot has to be placed inside an implant shop (like Borealis layout one) close to the 'Advanced Shiny Cluster' shop. It features:

- AOsetup links for full autonomous buying / tradeskilling
- Alternatively use the designer command
- Quickly make implants with one liner commands (example: create 159 head cl perception dimach)
- Laddering command to automatically make stamina / agility / treatment implants
- Place an order from anywhere, just make sure to claim it before the timer expires
- Bot automatically blacklists people whose orders have expired (you can pay the bot back the debt to get removed from the blacklist)
